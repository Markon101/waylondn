# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm currently working on Webdev/Personal Projects, and an aspiring Linux Dev

I am going to be using this repository for notes and particularly interesting information I come across.
One project I'm currently working on is a small text adventure game.

The beginning of this repository will be for code as I learn to develop more efficiently using different methods.

I hope to someday develop FOSS to help those with issues they may be having, and hopefully to help within the Linux community. It's been my favorite OS for many years, and has helped me improve in many skills within understanding CLI and bash.

Currently working on PHP, HTML, Javascript, Python, and C++.
VSCode is the current IDE I'm using, and so far prefer.
